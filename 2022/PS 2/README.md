## Questions:
### 1:
The Brisbane triathlon consists of a 500m swim, a 30km bike ride, and an 8km run. Samuel swims, cycles, and runs at constant rates. He runs fives times as fast as he swims, and he cycles twice as fast as he runs. Samuel completes the triathlon in four and a quarter hours. How many minutes does he spend cycling?

### 2:
The game of Scrabble gives values to letters: A=1,B=3,C=3,D=2,E=1, F = 4, G = 2, H = 4, I = 1, J = 8, K = 5, L = 1, M = 3, N = 1, O = 1, P = 3, Q=10,R=1,S=1,T=1,U=1,V=4,W=4,X=8,Y=4,Z=10. The value of a word is the sum of the values of the letters; eg, ONE = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. What is the smallest positive integer that has Scrabble score equal to itself?

### 3:
Two circles, each of radius 5 units, are drawn in the coordinate plane with their centers (0, 0) and (8, 0) respectively. How many points where both coordinates are integers lie within the intersection of these circles, including its boundary?

### 4:
Sam has seven boxes labelled 1 to 7, and he starts with n balloons, all in box 1. Sam may use any combination of the following two moves:
> Burst two balloons in box k and move a third balloon from box k to box k + 1.
> Burst a single balloon in each of boxes k and k + 1 and then move another balloon from box k+1 to box k+2.

### 5:
** For how many integers n between 1 and 2022 inclusive does the infinite nested expression below give a rational number?
√n+√n+√n+ ...
i.e. sqrt(n + sqrt(n + sqrt(n + ... )))

### 6:
** Working Problem Let f1 = 0,f2 = 1, and fn+2 = fn+1 + fn, for n = 1,2,... be the Fibonacci sequence. Show that there exists a strictly increasing infinite arithmetic sequence of integers that has no number in common with the Fibonacci sequence. [A sequence is arithmetic, if the difference of any of its consecutive terms is a constant.]
