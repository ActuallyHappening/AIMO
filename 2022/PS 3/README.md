# PS 3
## Questions:
### 1:
Find the least positive integer n such that no matter how 10n is expressed as the product of any two positive integers, at least one of these two integers contains the digit 0 in at least one place in its decimal representation. Decimal representation just means the usual digits and numbers you are used to (in base ten). For example, 205 contains the digit 0 in its decimal representation but 245 does not.
### 2:
Find the number of positive integers less than 1000 that can be expressed as a difference 3a − 3b where a and b are integers.
### 3:
Cath writes down the sides of a right-angled triangle and notices that:
(a) All lengths are two digit integers
(b) The digits of the hypotenuse are in reverse order to the digits of one of the other sides.
What is the perimeter of the triangle?
### 4:
A positive integer n is said to be plentiful if the sum of its factors (including 1 and itself) is greater than 2n. What is the largest odd plentiful number less than 1000? For example, 14 is not plentiful as its factors 1, 2, 7, 14 sum to only 24. Similarly 6 is not plentiful but 12 is plentiful.

### 5: (Harder)
** Find the last non-zero digit of 25! (where 25! = 25 × 24 × 23 × ... 2 × 1).

### 6: (Working)
Let S(n) denote the sum of the first n terms of the series 1−2+3−4+5−6+···.
For example, S(5) = 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + 5 = 3.
For what values of a and b does S(a) + S(b) + S(a + b) = 1?
