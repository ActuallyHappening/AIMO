### 2: (needs imaged attached)
Triangles ABC and XY Z are congruent right-angled isosceles triangles. Squares KLMB and PQRS are as shown. Given the area of KLMB is 189, find the area of PQRS.
### 3:
In a 5 × 5 grid of positive integers:
(a) all the numbers in the top row and the leftmost column are the same value;
(b) each other number is the sum of the number above it and the number to the left of it;
(c) the number in the bottom right hand corner is 2100. What is the number in the top left corner?

### 4:
A circle is inscribed in a hexagon ABCDEF so that each side of the hexagon is tangent to the circle. Find the perimeter of the hexagon if AB = 6, CD = 7, and EF = 8. To draw the diagram you may find it easier to draw a circle first and then draw the tangents of the hexagon afterwards - inscribed means the circle sits inside the hexagon, tangent to (i.e. just touching) each of the hexagon’s edges.
